This placement \nreinforces and expands on the main point, maintaining coherence and adding depth to the  argument about the \nSilk Roads' significance.  \n25-\n29. It is given that the 6 teams are divided in to two groups containing 3 teams each. As each team in the same \ngroup plays every other team once and in the other group twice, so there would be 3 matches among teams of \nsame group and 6 matches among teams of different group. Hence we can find the total matches in the \ntournament as 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24.  \nAlso every team plays exactly one game in one round means each round will have 3 matches involving each \nteam. Hence there will be 8 rounds in the tournament.  \n \nNow we will further analyse the given inform ation:  \nAs we can see that Team 3 played against Team 6 twice, Team 2 played against Team 5 twice and Team 1 \nplayed against Team 4 twice, so Teams 3 & 6, 2 & 5 and 1 & 4 are of different groups.   \nNow considering points 3 and 4, we get the information that Teams 4 and 6 are of different groups and \nTeams 1 and 5 are of same group.  \nHence we can say that Teams 1, 5 and 6 make a group (say Group I) and correspondingly Teams 2, 3 and 4 \n(say Group II) make the other group.  \n \nSo we can list down the matches which will be played among teams of Group I and Group II  \n      \nGroup I  Group II  \nTeam 1 Vs Team 6  Team 2 Vs Team 3  \nTeam 1 Vs Team 5  Team 2 Vs Team 4  \nTeam 5 Vs Team 6  Team 3 Vs Team 4  \n \nAlso we can make a list of matches which were played between teams of diffe rent groups::  \n \nTeam 3 Vs Team 6  \nTeam 2 Vs Team 5  \nTeam 1 Vs Team 4  \nTeam 3 Vs Team 5  \nTeam 1 Vs Team 3  \nTeam 2 Vs Team 6  \nTeam 1 Vs Team 2  \nTeam 4 Vs Team 6  \nTeam 4 Vs Team 5  \n \nFrom point 6, it is given that Team 3 played Team 8 and Team 2 played Team 5. Clubbing this information \nwith the information in point 1 that each team played against a team from the other group in Round 8, we can \nsurely conclude that the 3rd match of Round 8 must have been played between Team 1 and 4.  \n \nAlso as per point 2, match up s of Round 5 and Round 8 were identical. Hence we get the details of matches \nplayed in Round 5.  \nNow using information given in points 3, 4, 5 and 6, we will find the details of matches played in various \nrounds and put the information in a table where alph abet T stands for Team:  \n \nRound 1  Round 2  Round 3  Round 4  Round 5  Round 6  Round 7  Round 8  \nT4 Vs T6  T4 Vs T6  T3 Vs T4   T3 Vs T6  T1 Vs T6   T3 Vs T6  \n T1 Vs T5    T2 Vs T5    T2 Vs T5  \n    T1 Vs T4    T1 Vs T4  \n \nAs it is given that every team plays exactly one g ame in each round, so we can see that T6 would be \ndefinitely there in Round 4 and Round 7.  Considering the list of matches given for different groups, only T2 \nis left to play against T6. Hence T2 and T6 would play against each other in Round 4 and 7.  \n \nAlso match between T2 and T4 is to be played only once.

While the passage acknowledges that technological \ndevelopments are influencing cartographers, it does not focus on experimentation. The key shift mentioned is \nin cartographers' need to consider usability  rather than just the tools or innovations themselves.  \nOption A : \"Maps are being used for a variety of reasons and therefore map readers have become more \ndemanding.\"  \nWhile this is true to some extent, this summary is too vague and does not adequately capture the full essence \nof the passage. The passage emphasizes how technological advancements have made cartographers more \nconcerned with usability, not just the variety of reasons maps are used.  \n7. Option C : \"Workers made redundant by automation are unlikely to opt for crafts -related work.\" \u2013 The \npassage doesn't imply that workers would be unwilling to switch to crafts -related work. The primary concern \nis about whether the craft industry, as a whole, can accommodate such workers, not whether they would \nchoose it.  \nOption D : \"The low scale of crafts production will not be able to absorb the mass of redundant labour.\" \u2013 \nWhile the passage acknowledges that the scale of craft production may be low, the primary issue raised \nregarding employment is regulatory challenges , which a ffect the viability of small businesses, rather than \nthe scale of production itself.  \nOption A : \"Crafts guilds tend to resist new entrants and are unlikely to accept large numbers of trainees.\" \u2013 \nThis refers more to historical  issues with guilds and does no t directly address current challenges to creating \nemployment in the craft industry today.  \nTherefore, Option B  is the best fit as it reflects the challenge that regulatory requirements  pose to small \ncraft businesses, hindering their ability to compete and c reate substantial employment opportunities.  \n8. Option A : Craft guilds may have focused on quality, but mass production emphasizes standardization, not \nnecessarily quality. Inaccurate . \nOption D : Both systems were hierarchical, but the focus of the comparison is on creativity, not egalitarian \nprocesses. Partially relevant but not the main idea . \nOption C : Correctly identifies the similarity between both systems: their failure to promote creativ ity. Best \nchoice . \nOption B : Restricting entry is true for craft guilds, but mass production systems do not inherently discourage \nentry or innovation through strict rules. Inaccurate . \n9. Option D : Correctly reflects the passage\u2019s discussion about environmental concerns being a motivator for the \nrenewed interest in crafts. Relevant . \nOption C : Matches the passage, which mentions consumers wanting to support local workers or reduce their \nenvironmental impact. Relevant . \nOption B : Accurately reflects the niche market described for premium -quality craft goods. Relevant . \nOption A : While the p assage emphasizes the human touch in crafts, it does not explicitly state that the revival \nis due to support for individual creations  over mass production. Not explicitly mentioned . \n10. Option D : The agile movement  in software is linked to modern craftsmanship and creativity, not the \nrestrictive and hierarchical tenets of medieval craft guilds. Inconsistent . \nOption C : The passage emphasizes the importance of retaining creativity but does not explicitly state that  \nsupport for crafts is the only way to preserve it. Inconsistent . \nOption A : Matches the passage\u2019s argument that over -organization  could stifle creativity, as seen in \nhistorical examples like craft guilds. Consistent . \nOption B : The passage states that  the Arts and Crafts movement  was a reaction  to the \"American system\" \nof production, not inspired by it. Inconsistent . \n11.

Sentence 2  introduces Peter Singer\u2019s philosophical perspective on animal rights, presenting his utilitarian \nview and contrasting it with other indirect positions like welfareism.  \nSentence 3  follows up by explaining why Singer argues for extending moral consideration  to animals, \nfocusing on the idea that animals, like humans, have significant interests that deserve attention.  \nSentence 5  reinforces this point, concluding that humans have direct moral duties towards animals, treating \ntheir interests as equal to human in terests.  \nSentence 4  provides historical context, explaining how Singer\u2019s Animal Liberation  (1975) text publicly \nestablished animal rights as a legitimate issue within contemporary philosophy.  \nHowever, Sentence 1  is an outlier because it introduces a general statement about animals having basic needs \nand avoiding suffering. While the idea of moral consideration is central to the passage, Sentence 1  does not \ndirectly connect with the specific philosophical argument  or the historical context provided by the other  \nsentences. Instead, it is a broad statement that could be more fitting as an introduction to a different argument \nor a different part of the passage.  \n21.

Too narrow . \nOption A : Incorrectly claims that all codes have a natural origin, which the passage does not imply. It focuses \non naturalization, not natural origins. Inaccurate . \n22. Sentence 5  introduces the central idea: the puzzling decline in the use of urban public transport.  \nSentence 3  explains why this decline is happening, citing issues such as worsening services, terrorist attacks, \nand rising fares.  \nSentence 4  builds on this, sugg esting that the decline in public transport is part of a structural shift due to \nchanges in people's travel needs (smartphones, videoconferencing, etc.).  \nSentence 1  then explains that urbanites now have better alternatives (like Uber, dockless bikes, and \nscooters), which support the idea that public transport is less necessary.  \nSentence 2 , however, is about public transportation improving when more people use it, which doesn't fit the \ntheme of decline in usage or alternatives. It seems out of place in this context.  \n23. blank  1: Serves as a fitting introduction, contrasting intuitive organization (like a home office) with the \nbrain's evolutionary complexity. Best choice . \nblank  2: Placing the sentence here disrupts the flow, as the paragraph already transitions into describing the \nbrain's architecture. Misplaced . \nblank  3: This position focuses on the lack of harmony in the brain\u2019s systems, which builds on the earlier \ndiscussion  and doesn\u2019t suit the introductory nature of the sentence. Not suitable . \nblank  4: The metaphor of the brain as a \u201cbig, old house\u201d concludes the paragraph. Adding the sentence here \nwould weaken the strong ending. Unsuitable . \n24. Placing the sentence at blank 1 would interrupt the natural flow of thought. The paragraph at this point is \nintroducing the idea that Silk Roads nations, despite being seen as \"developing countries,\" have historically \nbeen crucial to global civilization. A dding the provided sentence here would make the transition feel abrupt \nand disconnected, as it would shift from describing the specific importance of the Silk Roads nations to a \nbroader statement about understanding developments globally. The placement is not ideal because the \ncontext here does not yet call for such a global perspective.  \nBlank  2: At this stage, the paragraph is focusing on the specific roles that the Silk Roads have played \nhistorically, particularly their function as networks for exchange \u2014of people, goods, and ideas. Inserting the \nprovided sentence here would feel out of place, as it does not directly build on this idea of exchanges along \nthe Silk Roads. Instead, the sentence shifts focus toward the broader implications of understanding Cent ral \nAsia's historical role in shaping global developments, which makes it mismatched for this location.  \nBlank  3: Here, the paragraph discusses the dual nature of the Silk Roads \u2014bringing both benefits and \nchallenges. Inserting the provided sentence at this juncture would create a thematic mismatch. The sentence \nabout understanding Central Asia\u2019s role does not naturally follow the ideas of destruction or disaster \nmentioned here. It fails to provide a logical connection or bridge between the existing ideas.  \nBlank 4: This is the most suitable placement for the provided sentence.

Option C : Implies that the author is judgmental about economics failing to manage crises. However, the \nfocus is on how economists' approaches have changed, not their ability to handle crises.

Then N has to give 10 stars to C which is not possible as total stars of N will exceed 30 and \ntotal stars of D would exceed 45.  \n \n \nThis case is shown below in the table::  \n \n M N O P X Y Total  \nA 10 25 0 5 0 5 45 \nB 0 0 0 25 0 20 45 \nC 5 10 30/0 0 0/30 0 45 \nD 15  0/30 0 30/0 5 45 \nTotal  30 30 30 30 30 30 180 \n \nSo we will the other case which would be valid in which C received 15 stars from M. So D received 5 stars \nfrom M. Hence either O or X gave 30 star s to C and D in any order.  \nSo we get the final table as follows  \n \n M N O P X Y Total  \nA 10 25 0 5 0 5 45 \nB 0 0 0 25 0 20 45 \nC 15 0 30/0 0 0/30 0 45 \nD 5 5 0/30 0 30/0 5 45 \nTotal  30 30 30 30 30 30 180 \n \nAs this table is satisfying all the conditions, so now all the questions can be answered.  \n       \n38. As it is given in the information that total number of stars received by the bloggers is the same, so each \nwould receive 180/4 = 45 stars. Hence answer is 45.  \n39. As shown in the table, D would receive 5 stars from Y. Hence option C.  \n40. From the table, we can infer that 2 surfers N and P distributed their stars among exactly 2 bloggers. (N \ndistributed his stars to A and D only and P distributed his stars to A and B only.  \n41. As shown in the table, th e number of stars received by C from M can be uniquely determined as 15. But we \ncannot determine the number of stars received by D from O. They could be either 0 or 30. Hence option C.   \n42. If both of them run staid campaigns focussing on issues, then th e percentage of students voting in the election \nwill be 20 times the sum of the levels of campaigning of the two students. So the percentage would be 20(1 + \n1) % = 40%.  \nBut as both of them run staid campaigns attacking the other, then 10% of 40% will not vote at all. Hence \nanswer would be 90% of 40% which is equal to 36%. Hence option D.   \n43. Minimum percentage of students who will vote will be obtained when they run staid campaign as it of level \n1.  \nAlso if they run staid campaigns attacking the other, then percentage voting would be further reduced. So \nminimum percentage will be obtained as 90% of 20(1 + 1)% = 90% of 40% = 36%. Hence option C.   \n44. If both of them run vigorous campaigns focussing on issues, then the percentage of students voting in th e \nelection will be 20 times the sum of the levels of campaigning of the two students. So the percentage would \nbe 20(2+2) % = 80%. Hence each of them would get 40% votes.   \nIt is given that Amiya runs a campaign focusing on issues. To maximise percentage of  votes she gets, will be \nobtained when Ramya run a campaign attacking their opponent.  \nSo the reduction in the percentage of votes obtained by Ramya would be 20% of 40% = 8% which would be \nadded to percentage of votes of Amiya. So Amiya would get 40% + 8% =  48% votes. Also 5% who would \nhave otherwise voted for Ramya, will not vote at all. Hence total reduction in the percentage of votes for \nRamya would be 8% + 5% of 40% = 10%. So answer of this question is 48%. Hence option C.   \n45. Minimum percentage of st udents who will vote will be obtained when they run staid campaign as it of level \n1.  \nIf both of them run staid campaigns focussing on issues, then the percentage of students voting in the election \nwill be 20 times the sum of the levels of campaigning of t he two students. So the percentage would be 20(1 + \n1) % = 40%. Hence each of them would get 20% votes.   \nIt is given that Ramya runs a campaign attacking their opponent. So the reduction in the percentage of votes \nobtained by Ramya would be 20% of 20% = 4%  which would be added to percentage of votes of Amiya.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21, "end_char_idx": 3812, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68b77566-52ab-43c8-9a7a-5eab26447975": {"__data__": {"id_": "68b77566-52ab-43c8-9a7a-5eab26447975", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "a81062b5-3658-4f4b-a248-39d6084c4615.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59fb32f5-eed6-4891-b344-63226d931854", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "a81062b5-3658-4f4b-a248-39d6084c4615.pdf"}, "hash": "9996cfe1c56dd55340f827e891e847a75011a1d71dd545a6dd5f060fc7bf9b68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Actual CAT 2024 \nSlot - I  \n \n30 \n\uf0de \u22123 =\nmn8\n\uf02d\uf02d \uf0de n \u2212 m = \n38  \nSubstitute, \u03b1 = \u22123 into the first equation, we get \u03b12 + m\u03b1 + 9 = 0  \n\uf0de 9 \u2212 3m + 9 = 0 \uf0de m = 6  \nSubstitute m = 6 in n \u2212 m = \n38 \uf0de n \u2212 6 = \n38\uf0de n = \n326  \nNow 2m + 3n = 2 \u00d7 6 + 3 \u00d7 \n326  = 12 + 26 = 38  \n54. 4 log 10 x + 4 log 100 x + 8 log 1000 x =13  \n\uf0de 4log 10x + \n24 log 10x + \n38 log 10x =13  \n\uf0de 4log 10x + 2 l og10x + \n38  log 10x =13  \nLet log 10x = k \uf0de 4k + 2k + \n38 k = 13  \nor 12k + 6k + 8k =39 \uf0de k = \n23  \nor log 10x = \n23  \uf0de x = \n1000 1023\n\uf03d = 31.62  \nSo, the greatest integer not exceedin g 31.62 = 31  \n55.

The conclusion, \u201cIndia was colonised for its spices and gold\u201d is not di rectly supported by the passage. The \nEast has been mentioned but direct reference to India being colonised for this is not there.  \nOption B can be concluded from the last paragraph. Refer to the line, \u201cSpices never had the enduring allure or \npower of gold and silver or the commercial potential of new products such as tobacco, indigo or sugar.\u201d  \nFor Option C and D, refer to the line, \u201cStill, demand was great enough to inspire the voyages of Christopher \nColumbus and Vasco Da Gama, launching the first fateful w ave of European colonialism.\u201d  \n8. The correct order here is 1532 and option 4 is the odd -one out. This order flows from a general statement \nabout the UK\u2019s leadership, to the benefits of cultivated meat, to the current status of the technology, and \nfinally,  the need for continued investment.  \nSentence 1 sets the stage by introducing the UK\u2019s leadership in the development of cultivated meat and \nhighlights an important milestone, the approval of cultivated pet food.  \nSentence 5 follows logically, explaining the potential benefits of cultivated meat, particularly in terms of \nreducing the negative impacts of traditional animal agriculture, which is a key motivator for developing this \ntechnology.  \nSentence 3 provides a specific update on the status of cultivated meat  applications, mentioning that the first \nUK applications for human consumption are under review by the Food Standards Agency.  \nSentence 2 concludes the paragraph by suggesting that government investment in research and infrastructure \nis essential for realiz ing the full benefits of cultivated meat.  \n9. The sentence to be fitted in is, \u201cYet each day the flock produced eggs with calcareous shells though they \napparently had not ingested any calcium from land which was entirely lacking in limestone.\u201d The sentence  \nstarts with \u2018Yet\u2019. It means something totally different or opposite should come before it as it makes for a \ncontrast pair.  In blank 1, the previous sentence just talks about Louis Kervran\u2019s childhood and him noticing a \nstrange fact in his father\u2019s poultr y yard.  \nIn blank 2, the sentence that comes before it and after it both talk about mica. There seems to be no gap.  \nIn blank 3, the sentence that comes before it states the hens consumed mica and not calcium and the sentence \nstarting with \u2018Yet\u2019 makes for a contrast pair. The observation, \u201cwhy the chickens selected the mica, or why \neach time a bird was killed for the family cooking pot no trace of the mica could be found in its gizzard\u201d, \nmakes for an interesting contrast as chickens had mica but what they d elivered was calcium. The sentence that \nfollows offers an explanation for it. So, nothing is required in Blank 4.  \n10. We have to pick the option that is not a reason why academics choose to review other scholars work. Option \nA, B and C can be traced to th ese lines, \u201cSome do it as a way to keep abreast with developments in their field; \nsome simply see it as a duty to the discipline\u201d and \u201cIn recent years, some scientists have begun posting their \nreviews online, mainly to claim credit for their work.\u201d  \nOption D is neither directly stated nor it can be derived as a reason for...  \n11. Option A can be inferred throughout the passage from the author\u2019s line of thought and especially from the last \nline, \u201cBut the norm should shift from opacity in all cases to opacity only when necessary.\u201d  \nOption B, C and D can\u2019t be inferred \u2013 peer review data has been mentioned but in a different context; option C \nand D are clearly beyond what has been stated.  \n12. Here, we have to pick an option that is not the reason for making peer review data public. Option A, B and C \nare mentioned in the passage. Refer to lines, \u201cSharing peer review data could help journals stamp out fraud, \ninefficiency, and systemic bias in academic publishing.....\u201d; \u201cPeer review data could also help root out bias . \nLast year, a study based on peer review data for nearly 24,000 submissions to the biomedical journal eLife \nfound that women and non - Westerners were vastly underrepresented among peer reviewers\u201d; and \u201cOpenly \npublishing peer review data could perhaps also  help journals address another problem in academic publishing: \nfraudulent peer reviews.\u201d  \nHowever, Option D does not favour making peer review data public as it talks about the problem of selecting \nappropriately qualified peer reviewers.  \n13. Here, we need  to pick an option that does not carry the reason why some are supposed to making peer reviews \npublic. Option A, B and D can be found in the passage as reasons. Refer to lines, \u201cOpponents of open peer \nreview commonly argue that confidentiality is vital to the integrity of the review process; referees may be less \ncritical of manuscripts if their reports are published, especially if they are revealing their identities by signing \nthem. Some also hold concerns that open reviewing may deter referees from agreein g to judge manuscripts in \nthe first place, or that they'll take longer to do so out of fear of scrutiny....\u201d  \n14. It\u2019s not given anywhere or hinted at that technological advances in the past have always had innocuous or \nbeneficial outcomes. They may have i t sometimes. Refer to lines in the first para, \u201cSometimes those \nconsequences are innocuous ones, or even beneficial.\u201d  \nFor Option A, refer to lines, \u201cas it becomes increasingly possible for individuals or small groups to create new \nscientific advances throu gh chemistry or biotechnology or materials science setting off unintended \nconsequences that reverberate on a global scale\u201d.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21, "end_char_idx": 5709, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2175f884-f7e1-47d2-870a-9be15641a335": {"__data__": {"id_": "2175f884-f7e1-47d2-870a-9be15641a335", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "a81062b5-3658-4f4b-a248-39d6084c4615.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9b5a279c-9f45-4d89-9102-b76af4994ccd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "a81062b5-3658-4f4b-a248-39d6084c4615.pdf"}, "hash": "4699049aa1349e8087366303a539d68e2a239e0132851850341c785758373689", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Actual CAT 2024 \nSlot - II  \n \n20 \nExplanation Actual CAT Slot - II \n \n \nQ. \nNo Explanation  \n1. The text\u2019s primary foc us is physicists collaborating with experts from other fields to answer questions about \nour world. Their approaches might have some differences they nevertheless have resulted in benefits (means \nimportant findings, which is their objective).  \nOption C incl udes this core.  \nOption A says they have \u201cburied their differences in research methods applied in other fields\u201d, which has not \nbeen mentioned. In spite of their differences, they have been somewhat successful.  \nOption B There is no mention of large data sets  and mathematical models in physics combined with research \nmethods of other fields.  \nOption D There\u2019s no desire to diversify their research. There have been differences in approaches and that \nhave stayed yet some benefits have been seen.  \n2. The sentence, \u201c [T]he Europeans did not invent globalisation\u201d hints that if they didn\u2019t invent it then it was \nalready there. We need a context that what was there before the Europeans made the big leap. It was the trade \nthat was going on between China and peoples of South east Asia.  \nIn the first blank, there\u2019s no gap. People of Southeast Asia supplied goods to the Chinese and the same thing is \nmentioned after the blank...these exchanges.  \nBefore the second blank, it has been mentioned that the exchanges of the year 1000 ope ned some of the \nroutes...and after the blank a contrast pair is made with the use of \u2018Yet\u2019 that means something different from \nwhat has been said or opposite to what has been said. So, the second blank is not suitable for that sentence.  \nAfter the third bla nk, it is given, \u201cthey changed and augmented what was already there since 1000\u201d. It goes \nperfectly well with \u201cThe Europeans did not invent it but they just changed and made it greater.  \nThere\u2019s no gap even in the fourth option as the words, \u201cIf the globalis ation hadn\u2019t yet begun...\u201d must have a \nfixed time before it, which is there in the previous sentence.  \n3. The para talks about how states conduct warfare using the DIME model (Diplomacy, information, military, \nand economics). The states try or do everythin g before deploying the military. Then the focus shifts to \ninformation, how the states monitor telecom data and communications and also use cyber troops on social \nmedia to influence public opinion.  \nOption D includes the main focus.  \nOption A is incorrect as  it says governments primarily use the DIME model to deploy cyber troops, which is \nnot true. The DIME model includes diplomacy, information, military and economics. Using cyber troops is \njust further part of the information tool and not all of them.  \nOption  B is incorrect as it is also confusing the trajectory of thought in the text and mismatching different \nparts. Further, the focus is lost amid other details.  \nOption C is incorrect as using the DIME Model and military simultaneously has not been talked abou t. \nMilitary is a part of the DIME model.  \n4. We have to select an option that states what would happen  if a trader brought white peppercorns from India \nto medieval Europe.  During those time, Europeans thought pepper in India grew on trees guarded by serpa nts, \n\u201cThe only way to harvest pepper was to burn the trees, which would drive the snakes underground. Of course, \nthis bit of lore would explain the shriveled black peppercorns, but not white, pink or other colors.\u201d So, they \nwould doubt the story of pepper harvesting.  \nOption A, C and D are beyond the scope of the given text.  \n5. The third paragraph states why the spices were highly prized in Europe, \u201cMedieval purchasers consumed meat \nmuch fresher than what the average city -dweller in the developed world of t oday has at hand. However, \nrefrigeration was not available, and some hot spices have been shown to serve as an anti -bacterial agent. \nSalting, smoking or drying meat were other means of preservation. Most spices used in cooking began as \nmedical ingredients,  and throughout the Middle Ages spices were used as both medicines and condiments. \nAbove all, medieval recipes involve the combination of medical and culinary lore in order to balance food's \nhumeral properties and prevent disease.\u201d Spices acted both as med icines as well as condiments. From here it \ncan be inferred that Option B, C and D contributed to a decline in the allure of spices but their increased \navailability has not much to do with it.  \n6.

For option C, \u201cThe diversity  and interspersion of working landscapes with carnivore habitats in rural areas \nincrease the statistical probability of encounters between humans and carnivores\u201d, refer to the lines in the last \nparagraph, \u201cThere are a lot of working landscapes in the Globa l South that are really heterogeneous, that are \ninterspersed with carnivore habitats, forests and savannahs, which creates a lot more opportunity for these \nencounters, just statistically.\"  \nOption A goes against the passage as low -income countries are more prone to human -carnivore conflict.  \nOption B is incorrect as it\u2019s not homogenous but it\u2019s heterogeneous landscapes that are more likely to \nexperience such conflicts.  \nOption D is incorrect as it also goes against what is mentioned in the passage.  \n21. For op tion B \u201cThe reduction in carnivores' instinctive fear response, resulting from their reliance upon human -\nprovided food\u201d, refer to lines, \u201cCarnivores that recognise humans as a means to get food, are a different story. \nAs they become more reliant on human f ood they might find at campsites or in rubbish bins, they become less \navoidant of humans.\u201d  \nOption A, C and D state reasons that could lead to more conflicts between animals and humans rather than \nlead to \u2018habituation\u2019 (becoming used to something), which is  asked in the question.  \n22.

By externalities, the author means unintended consequences or secondary effects. We need to pick an option \nthat is not a secondary effect but it should be the primary invention. Here, the invention of Air Conditioners \nfor a specific purpose is primary . Refer to the lines, \u201cWhen Willis Carrier hit upon the idea of air -\nconditioning, the technology was primarily intended for industrial use: ensuring cool, dry air for factories that \nrequired low -humidity environments.\u201d  \nOption A, B and D are secondary effec ts.

These inventors had their own individual objectives. The hardly had any idea regarding the exte rnalities.

Consider the words, \u201cOftentimes the secondary \neffects seem to belong to an entire ly different sphere of society\u201d; \u201cSometimes the unintended consequence \ncomes about when consumers use an invention in a surprising way. Edison famously thought his phonograph, \nwhich he sometimes called \"the talking machine,\" would primarily be used to take  dictation....But then later \ninnovators... discovered a much larger audience willing to pay for musical recordings made on descendants of \nEdison's original invention.\u201d  \nOption B is incorrect as the unintended consequences were largely beneficial is not supp orted by the passage.  \nOption C is incorrect as \u201cinventions being used for entirely different purposes\u201d is not right in all the cases that \nhave been mentioned.  \nOption D is incorrect as the author is not trying to prove that past inventions mostly resulted in creation of \nnew inventions.  \n18. Option A is supported by the lines, \u201c...Penteriani's team believes 50% could have been avoided if humans \nreacted differently. A 2017 study co -authored by Penteriani found that engaging in risky behaviour around \nlarge car nivores increases the likelihood of an attack.\u201d  \nTwo of the most common risky behaviours are parents leaving their children to play outside unattended and \nwalking an unleashed dog, according to the study. Wilkinson says 66% of coyote attacks involve a dog. \n\"[People] end up in a situation where their dog is being chased, or their dog chases a coyote, or maybe they're \nwalking their dog near a den that's marked, and the coyote wants to escort them away,\" says Wilkinson.  \nOption B is incorrect as attempting to ph otograph wild animals from within secured areas would not \nexacerbate the attacks.  \nOption C is incorrect as addressing the impact of climate change would also not increase the attacks as climate \nchange is also cited to be one of the reasons behind the incre asing number of attacks.  \nOption D is incorrect as implementing food waste management strategies would likely decrease the attacks.  \n19. Option D is inconsistent with the passage, which mentions that climate change plays a part in escalating \nhuman -carnivore  conflicts, although the exact correlation is still being studied. It highlights that scarcity of \nresources due to climate change leads to more frequent encounters between humans and carnivores, which \ncould increase conflict. Therefore, stating that climat e change has negligible effects directly contradicts this \ninformation.  \nOption A: \"Predatory attacks by carnivores are a common occurrence and have steadily increased over the \npast few decades.\"  \nThis statement is incorrect because the passage states that pr edatory attacks are rare, accounting for only 17% \nof attacks in North America since 1955.

The line \u201cThrough its mastery of language, AI could even form intimate relationships with people, and use the \npower of intimacy to change our opinions and worldviews\u201d  clearly suggests that the author thinks AI can use \nthe power of intimacy to shape people's worldviews. There is no implication that this emotional manipulation \ncould exacerbate the polarization of world views.  \nOption B is wrong as the lines \u201cAI can create complete ly new ideas, completely new culture...\" clearly \nindicate that AI has the ability to create completely new ideas and, therefore, new cultures which is a \nsignificant threat to human civilization.  \nOption C is wrong as the author expresses a clear concern abo ut AI's role in potentially subverting democratic \nprocesses, particularly through the generation of fake news and political content\u2026 Refer to the lines \u201c Think of \nthe next American presidential race in 2024, \u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026.. mass -produce political content, fake -news  stories and \nscriptures for the new cult.\"  \u201c Democracy is a conversation\u2026\u2026\u2026, thereby destroying democracy.\u201d  \nOption D is wrong. Refer to the lines \" What would happen once a non -human intelligence becomes better \nthan the average human at telling stories, co mposing melodies, drawing images, and writing laws and \nscriptures?\"  \n2. Refer the lines, \u201cUnregulated AI\u2026. which would benefit autocrats and ruin democracies. Democracy is a \nconversation \u2026.. When AI hacks language, \u2026\u2026..thereby destroying democracy...\"  \nThis clearly indicates that the author believes one of the greatest dangers posed by AI is its ability to disrupt \nthe democratic process, making Option C the correct choice.  \nOption A: The passage discusses the risks and dangers of unregulated AI, particularly  its potential to \nmanipulate culture, language, and democracy. The author does not discuss the positive impacts of AI making \nOption A incorrect.  \nOption B: The author does not dismiss the fears about AI harming humanity. In fact, they highlight the \nsignific ant dangers AI could pose, particularly in terms of language manipulation and its effects on society and \ndemocracy. The passage mentions that AI could form intimate relationships with humans and manipulate \nopinions, which implies real concerns about its ne gative impact. Therefore, Option B is also incorrect.  \nOption D: The passage does mention concerns about AI being used by students (such as ChatGPT writing \nessays), however the author shifts the focus to much broader, more significant issues, such as the po tential for \nAI to influence political processes and subvert democracy. The author does not argue that fears about AI in \nschools are unfounded; rather, they suggest that these concerns are a distraction from the larger issues. \nTherefore, Option D is incorre ct as well.  \n3. Option D is correct as the author highlights how language is crucial in creating cultural artefacts, conveying \nhuman values, and influencing opinions, but does not suggest that language is the basis for AI tools like \nChatGPT. While AI tools  use language, the primary focus of the author is on how language underpins human \nsociety and culture and how its manipulation by AI can have terrible consequences for human civilization.  \nOption A: Refer to the line , \u201cHuman rights, for example, aren\u2019t insc ribed in our DNA. Rather, they are \ncultural artefacts we created by telling stories and writing laws.\"  \nOption B: This is correct because the passage underscores how language is the key to expressing and \nspreading human values, culture, and societal norms. The author writes: \"Language is the stuff almost all \nhuman culture is made of.\"  \nOption C: Refer to line, \"AI could even form intimate relationships with people, and use the power of intimacy \nto change our opinions and worldviews.\"  \n4. The author raises sig nificant concerns over AI\u2019s potential to disrupt language, culture, democracy, and human \nrelationships. The overall tone of the passage warns readers about the risks of these tools and calls for quick \nregulation. The author writes:  \n\"We can still regulate t he new AI tools, but we must act quickly... Unregulated AI deployments would create \nsocial chaos, which would benefit autocrats and ruin democracies.\"  \nThis tone of caution about the future impacts of AI is a defining characteristic of the passage.  \nOption A: While the passage does contain a rhetorical question at the end, this is not the dominant tone of the \npassage. The focus is not on curiosity or uncertainty but on the dangers of AI and the need for regulation.  \nOption B: The author raises significant con cerns but does so with reason and logic, aiming to provoke thought \nand call for regulation, rather than inducing panic. The focus is on the adverse consequences and their \nimplications, not on sensationalizing the threat.  \nOption C: While the passage does di scuss the future impact of AI tools, the tone is more focused on warning \nabout the immediate need for regulation and action to avoid negative consequences.

Instead, the author mentions how other countries (like China) have \nalready sent probes to the Moon and experimented with growing plants, without the same level of protest seen \nin the U.S. There is no claim that probes have  had little effect on the environment in the passage.  \nOption A: Refer to paragraph 2.  \nOption C: Refer to para 3\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s important\u2026\u2026.many international competitors will ignore\u2026.China recently \nsent\u2026.\u201d  \nOption D: Refer to para 4\u2026. \u201cU.S. lunar landings did not l eave the campsites cleaner than they found it\u2026\u201d  \n17. : In the first paragraph, the author seems to be questioning and doubting the planetary protection advocates \nwho push for sterilizing robotic probes to avoid contaminating possible, but not proven, biosp heres. The \nauthor points out how much money NASA spends on cleaning these probes, and suggests that these efforts \nmight be a bit over the top, especially since there\u2019s no solid evidence that life exists on Mars or any other \nplanets yet.  \nOption A: The autho r does not approve of the significant expenses involved in these efforts, but instead \nsuggests that the costs are perhaps too high for uncertain benefits.  \nOption C: The author is not indifferent. In fact, there is an implied critique of the elitist perspec tive of the \nplanetary protection advocates, but the main focus is on the excessive efforts to sterilize space missions, not \nindifference to elitism.  \nOption D: The tone is not equivocal (uncertain); the author is clear in their skepticism about these effort s and \nis questioning them, not presenting a balanced or indecisive view.  \n18. The passage highlights how the scientific communities in different countries (China and Israel) react \ndifferently to space contamination. While China\u2019s actions (sending a terrari um to the moon) sparked no \nprotest, Israel\u2019s actions (smuggling tardigrades) led to a significant uproar. This suggests that national \nscientists may have varying sensitivities or approaches to issues like biosphere protection.  \nOption A: The passage doesn\u2019t  discuss the type of contamination (animal vs. plant) or its relative importance. \nThe focus is on the reactions to the actions, not the severity of the contamination.  \nOption B: While the reactions to China and Israel are different, the passage doesn\u2019t emph asize global biases. \nThe focus is more on the scientific communities in each country, rather than on general global biases.  \nOption D: The passage does not claim that China\u2019s actions are particularly reasonable. It contrasts the lack of \nprotest over China\u2019s  actions with the strong reaction to Israel\u2019s, but it doesn\u2019t suggest one is more reasonable \nthan the other.  \n19. On simplifying, the question is asking what point the author is likely to disagree with.  The author disagrees \nwith the idea of placing heavy emphasis on minimizing contamination until life is ruled out. The author argues \nthat life on Mars or other bodies has not been conclusively proven, and the emphasis on contamination should \nnot outweigh the need for exploration and development.  \nOption A: Th e author agrees with the idea of a compromise approach, where Mars is divided into different \nzones for science, habitation, and resource exploitation.  \nOption B: The author acknowledges that earlier NASA missions, such as the Apollo missions, did not focus \non sterility, but they also did not cause significant harm. The author suggests that the concerns about \ncontamination in previous missions were somewhat exaggerated.  \nOption C: The author argues that the costs of sterilizing probes and maintaining a pristin e environment are \nunsustainable and that focusing too much on contamination could limit human exploration. \u201c\u2026.scrubbing \neverything and hauling out all the trash, would destroy NASA\u2019s human exploration budget and encroach on \nthe agency\u2019s other directorates,  too. Getting future astronauts off Mars is enough of a challenge, without \ntrying to tote weeks of waste along as well.\u201d  \n20. The passage doesn\u2019t mention anything about jobs or economic opportunities helping to save languages. It\u2019s \nmore about physical dest ruction and forced cultural changes, not giving jobs to locals to help them survive.  \nOption A: This could be true because in North America, European colonists took native children away from \ntheir families to boarding schools to erase their cultures. If thi s didn\u2019t happen as much in South America, it \nmight explain why languages there survived a bit better.  \nOption B: In North America, colonists were really successful in pushing their own culture and language onto \nthe locals. If South American colonists weren\u2019 t as successful at forcing locals to adopt their ways, it might \nhave helped the local languages survive longer.  \nOption D: The passage talks about how many Native American communities were wiped out, which led to \nmany languages disappearing.

The paragraph highlights the tension between lyric poetry's personal focus and Marxism\u2019s societal focus, \nwhile also suggesting that lyric poetry could still serve a critical purpose. It acknowledges that although lyric \npoetry is personal and oft en focused on the small scale, it can function as a form of resistance against a \nrepressive culture \u2014 something the passage hints at when it discusses how poetry may be implicitly critical or \nutopian. Option B captures this idea.  \nOption A: The focus of the  passage is more on the possibility of lyric poetry serving a role in resisting \noppression, rather than solely highlighting Marxism\u2019s internal contradictions.  \nOption C: This option is not entirely correct because it suggests that the resolution of the tens ion between \nMarxism and lyric poetry is necessary for poetry to avoid being utopian. The passage does not argue that a \nresolution is required for poetry to be utopian; rather, it suggests that lyric poetry may inherently be utopian \nbut can still serve a cr itical function.  \nOption D: The passage does not suggest that Marxism makes \"unreasonable demands\" on lyric poetry. Neither \ndoes it argue that Marxism \"ignores\" the merits of poetry.  \n6. The sentence describes financial stress due to new and previously unin curred costs, which is directly related to \nthe idea of workers experiencing increased expenses after a period of remote work. Blank 3 is the best fit as it \ndiscusses how workers were able to save during remote work, when the additional costs (like transpor tation, \nlunches, etc.) were absent, which aligns well with the sentence that talks about the stress of these newly \nincurred costs.  \nOption A introduces the rising costs (petrol, food) but doesn\u2019t immediately connect with the stress of the \nadded costs worker s are now facing.  \nOption B talks about wage stagnation, but it\u2019s not as directly related to the personal stress caused by the new \nreturn -to-office costs.  \nOption D is about a specific example of spending return -to-office costs, but it\u2019s more about individua l cases \nrather than the general sentiment about the costs employees are now facing.  \n7. Option C: This option works best because it connects directly to the earlier sentence about the horrifying \nphotograph and gives more historical context and significance  to the image, specifically about the title and \nnickname of the photograph.  \nOption A: It\u2019s more focused on the children\u2019s reaction (terror, pain, confusion) and the visual details the \nsentence would break the flow of the narrative if it were placed right a fter the opening sentence.  \nOption B: This too would break the flow in describing the terrifying visual of children fleeing from the \nravages of destruction and weary soldiers following after them.  \nOption D: The focus here is on the nickname of the 9 -year-old girl at the center of the photo, which should \ncome after the paragraph has discussed the photograph's historical and emotional impact.  \n8.

The passage \nsuggest s that targeting the wealthy market remains a good strategy for Moutai.  \nOption B: This cultural factor contributes to Moutai\u2019s success, but it is not a threat. In fact, it is described as a \nstrong foundation for Moutai\u2019s continued sales in the present and near future.  \nOption D: While government involvement can pose risks, it is not both a reason for success and a threat in the \nsame way the appeal to the older demographic is. The passage mainly discusses the government\u2019s control over \npricing, which is presen ted as a risk, but not an immediate factor of success in the way the appeal to older \nconsumers is.  \n9. Option C: The author contrasts Moutai\u2019s marketing strategy with typical Western business practices, such as \ndigital marketing, environmental sustainabili ty, and appeal to millennials. Moutai\u2019s marketing strategy is \nunconventional, ignoring Western business mantras in favor of appealing to Chinese nationalism, the super -\nrich, and older generations. The author refers to this combination as an \"unholy trinity \" because it contradicts \nthe Western approach to business.  \nOption A: While nationalism is a key factor in Moutai\u2019s success, it alone doesn't explain the term.  \nOption B: The main focus of the passage is the contradiction between Moutai\u2019s strategy and Wester n \npractices, not the long -term risks directly.  \nOption D: The author does not make any moral judgments on the marketing techniques of Moutai.  \n10. The author implies that Moutai\u2019s claimed ability to be hangover -proof is so remarkable that it could be \nconsid ered revolutionary \u2014much like gunpowder was a revolutionary invention.

It is a figurative comparison, not a focus on tangible substance.  \nOption D: Moutai and gun powder do  not mean the same.  \n11. The author emphasizes that Moutai focuses on serving China's super -rich and not its middle class, as many \nfirms have failed in the highly competitive market targeting the middle class\u2026 \u201cSecond, it chose\u2026. rather \nthan its middle cla ss.

It mentions that the premium market for liquor in China, \ncatering to the super -rich, is massive and less crowded compared to the middle -class market, making it a \nlucrative target for Moutai.  \nOption C: The passage mentions that the Chinese government is involved in Moutai\u2019s pricing, with the \ngovernment being the largest sharehol der and trying to keep prices stable, which could be seen as controlling \nthe pricing.  \n12. Option D best summarises how the tradwife's actions, such as her commitment to vintage fashion and \ntraditional roles, are depicted as exposing the superficial nature  of modern life. The passage emphasizes how \nshe challenges current societal norms by insisting on an idealized, seemingly \"primitive\" way of life, which \ncontrasts sharply with modern, artificial values.  \nOption A: The passage highlights how the tradwife's a ctions aren't just critiques of modern ideals, but are also \na deliberate challenge to societal norms. It\u2019s more than just a critique; it\u2019s a direct confrontation with and \nmockery of those norms. This option misses the crucial idea of the tradwife \"highligh ting\" and \"challenging\" \nthose norms in a way that makes others feel \"hollow\" and \"cheated.\"  \nOption B: This option doesn't fully capture the idea of \"challenging\" or \"mocking\" societal norms, which is a \nkey part of the passage. The word \"reveal\" here is too  passive compared to the active, more confrontational \nrole the tradwife plays in making others feel \"hollow\" and \"cheated\" by exposing the contradictions in modern \nvalues.  \nOptions 3: Option C is not the correct answer because it uses the passive term \"expo ses,\" which fails to \ncapture the active confrontation central to the passage. The tradwife's behavior is not just about revealing \nsuperficiality, but about challenging and forcing others to confront the hollow nature of modern values. The \npassage emphasize s her role as a \"troll,\" actively beating society at its own game, which is better captured by \nthe word \"challenges\" in Option D.  \n13. The sentence talks about displacement, which ties in well with the context of \"pastoralists\" (people who rely \non livestoc k for their livelihood) never being able to return home, which comes after blank 4. Hence Option A \nis correct.  \nOption B: Inserting the sentence in blank 1 would break the continuity of describing the drought's severity.  \nOption C: Blank 2 introduces the eff ects of the drought too early, while the displacement sentence works \nbetter after the broader context of food insecurity.  \nOption D: The sentence before blank 3 discusses the far -reaching consequences of the drought, which \nlogically flows into the next sent ence about farmers and pastoralists. Inserting the sentence in blank 3 will \nbreak this continuity.  \n14. Sentence 2 talks about the early interest in forecasting from the intelligence community.

Option B goes against the main idea of the passage because it suggests that a liberal arts education should \nfocus on mastering the top global languages, like En glish or Spanish. But the passage is all about valuing and \npreserving endangered languages, not just learning widely spoken ones. The idea is to encourage a deeper \nunderstanding of diverse cultures and languages, especially those at risk of disappearing, w hich wouldn\u2019t \nhappen if the focus was only on the most common languages.  \nOption A: The fact that most liberal arts students will pursue jobs in fields like publishing or HR instead of \nlinguistics doesn\u2019t contradict the passage. The author is clear that eve n students who don't become linguistics \nexperts can still play a role in preserving endangered languages through cultural awareness and empathy.  \nOption C: The idea that schools teaching endangered languages might only preserve them for a generation \ndoesn\u2019t  go against the passage's central theme. The passage acknowledges that some endangered languages are \nhard to save, but it also shows that efforts, like teaching endangered languages in schools, can make a \ndifference, even if it's only for one generation.  \nOption D: The statement that recording a dying language freezes it in time doesn\u2019t directly challenge the \npassage\u2019s message. While the passage emphasizes the importance of actively preserving and revitalizing \nlanguages, it also notes the value of documentin g them, even if that\u2019s just to capture a snapshot of the \nlanguage before it\u2019s lost.  \n22. The passage focuses on the loss of cultural knowledge, worldview, and unique perspectives when a language \nbecomes extinct. Option B discusses the loss of a group from a government list of indigenous tribes, which is \nmore about legal or administrative status rather than the cultural and intellectual loss emphasized in the \npassage.  \nOption A: This is exactly the kind of loss the passage talks about. The extinction of a lan guage can lead to the \nloss of unique cultural knowledge, including how a group perceives and interacts with their environment.  \nOption C: The passage stresses that languages carry with them unique cultural and emotional expressions that \nare tied to the way people think and experience the world. The passage highlights that when a language \ndisappears, it doesn't just take the words with it, but also the feelings and meanings those words represent.  \nOption D: This is another example of the kind of cultural and e nvironmental knowledge the passage describes. \nThe Nicobarese language, with its descriptions of 20 different moods of the ocean, reflects a unique way of \nunderstanding and interpreting the natural world.  \n23. While the passage mentions that some students m ay engage in language preservation (like recording dying \nlanguages), it does not suggest that the primary role of liberal arts students is to establish schools specifically \nfor preserving languages. This is more of an extreme, specialized activity that onl y a few students might \npursue.  \nOption A: A liberal arts education helps students recognize and understand their own cultural biases and \npractices. By learning about other languages and cultures, they gain insights into their own. This is aligned \nwith the p assage\u2019s idea that students can become more empathetic and culturally aware.  \nOption C: The passage discusses how studying different languages and cultures helps students navigate \ncultural differences and communicate more effectively across cultural lines. This is a clear benefit of a liberal \narts education.  \nOption D: The passage emphasizes the importance of learning languages, particularly those at risk of \nextinction, to understand and preserve different worldviews.  \n24. The passage discusses the outdated n ature of the current regulatory framework for biotechnology, particularly \nin the context of regulating living organisms, which are unpredictable and unique. It questions whether \nregulation can ever keep up with the pace of innovation, particularly when it comes to the risks and variations \nthat emerge when new biological entities are introduced.  \nOption A: The option focuses too much on the impossibility of imagining all risks, which the passage does not \nemphasize. The passage discusses outdated regulation an d the challenge of adapting to unpredictability, rather \nthan the sheer impossibility of imagining outcomes.  \nOption B: Doesn't capture the essence of the passage, which raises doubts about whether regulation can \nactually keep up with rapid innovation in bio technology, especially considering the unpredictability of \nbiological entities.  \nOption D: It introduces the idea that scientists should shape the regulations, which is not directly suggested in \nthe passage.  \n25 -\n29.
