Choose the \nbest answer to each question.  \n \nIn the summer of 2022, subscribers to the US s treaming service HBO MAX were alarmed to  discover that \ndozens of the platform\u2019s offerings \u2014 from the Covid -themed heist thriller Locked  Down to the recent remake \nof The Witches \u2014 had been quietly  \n removed from the service . . .  The news seemed like vindica tion to those who had long warned that streaming \nwas more  about controlling access to the cultural commons than expanding it, as did reports (since  denied by \nthe show\u2019s creators) that Netflix had begun editing old episodes of Stranger Things  to retroactive ly improve \ntheir visual effects.  \n \nWhat's less clear is whether the commonly prescribed cure for these cultural ills \u2014 a return to  the material \npleasures of physical media \u2014 is the right one. While the makers of Blu -ray discs  claim they have a shelf life \nof 100 years, such statistics remain largely theoretical until they  come to pass, and are dependent on storage \nconditions, not to mention the continued  availability of playback equipment. The humble DVD has already \nproved far less resilient, with  many early releases already beginning to deteriorate in quality Digital movie \npurchases  provide even less security. Any film \u201cbought\u201d on iTunes could disappear if you move to  another \nterritory with a different rights agreement and try to redownload it. It\u2019s a bold ne w frontier in the \ncommodification of art: the birth of the product recall. After a man took to Twitter  to bemoan losing access to \nCars 2 after moving from Canada to Australia, Apple clarified that  users who downloaded films to their \ndevices would retain pe rmanent access to those  downloads, even if they relocated to a hemisphere where the \n[content was] subject to a  different set of rights agreements. Thanks to the company\u2019s ironclad digital rights  \nmanagement technology, however, such files cannot be moved or  backed up, locking you into  watching with \nyour Apple account.  \n \nAnyone who does manage to acquire Digital Rights Management free (DRM -free) copies of  their favourite \nfilms must nonetheless grapple with ever -changing file format standards, not to  mention da ta decay \u2014 the \ngradual process by which electronic information slowly but surely  corrupts. Only the regular migration of files \nfrom hard drive to hard drive can delay the  inevitable, in a sisyphean battle against the ravages of digital time.  \n \nIn a sense, n one of this is new. Charlie Chaplin burned the negative of his 1926 film A Woman  of the Sea as a \ntax write -off. Many more films have been lost through accident, negligence or  plain indifference. During a \nheat wave in July 1937, a Fox film vault in New Jers ey burned  down, destroying a majority of the silent films \nproduced by the studio.  \n \nBack then, at least, cinema was defined by its ephemerality: the sense that a film was as  good as gone once it \nleft your local cinema. Today, with film studios keen to stres s the breadth of their back catalogues (or to put in \nHollywood terms, the value of their IPs),  audiences may start to wonder why those same studios seem happy \nto set the vault alight  themselves if it'll help next quarter\u2019s numbers.  \n \n1. \u201cNetflix had begun e diting old episodes of Stranger Things to retroactively improve  their visual \neffects.\u201d What is the purpose of this example used in the passage?  \n \n A.

To show that streaming services are controlling access to the cultural commons  rather than \nexpanding it.  \n C.

Based on the \npassage, choose the best answer for each question.  \n \nOftentimes, when economists c ross borders, they are less interested in learning from others  than in invading \ntheir garden plots. Gary Becker, for instance, pioneered the idea of human  capital. To do so, he famously \ntackled topics like crime and domesticity, applying methods  honed in t he study of markets to domains of \nnonmarket life. He projected economics outward  into new realms: for example, by revealing the extent to \nwhich humans calculate marginal  utilities when choosing their spouses or stealing from neighbors. At the \nsame time, he  did not  let other ways of thinking enter his own economic realm: for example, he did not \nborrow from  anthropology or history or let observations of nonmarket economics inform his homo  economic  \nus. Becker was a picture of the imperial economist in the heyd ay of the discipline\u2019s  bravura.  \n \nTimes have changed for the once almighty discipline. Economics has been taken to task,  within and beyond its \nramparts. Some economists have reached out, imported, borrowed, and  collaborated \u2014been less imperial, \nmore open. Co nsider Thomas Piketty and his outreach to  historians. The booming field of behavioral \neconomics \u2014the fusion of economics and social  psychology \u2014is another case. Having spawned active \nsubfields, like judgment, decision -making and a turn to experimentation, th e field aims to go beyond the \ncaricature of Rational  Man to explain how humans make decisions....  \n \nIt is important to underscore how this flips the way we think about economics. For  generations, economists \nhave presumed that people have interests \u2014\u2018preferen ces,\u201d in the  neoclassical argot \u2014that get revealed in the \ncourse of peoples\u2019 choices. Interests come before  actions and determine them. If you are hungry, you buy \nlunch; if you are cold, you get  a sweater. If you only have so much money and can't afford to deal with both \nyour growling  stomach and your shivering, which need you choose to meet using your scarce savings  reveals \nyour preference.  \n \nPsychologists take one look at this simple formulation and shake their heads. Increasingly,  even some \nmainstream econ omists have to admit that homo economic  us doesn\u2019t always  behave like the textbook \nmaximizer; irrational behavior can\u2019t simply be waved away as extra -economic expressions of passions over \ninterests, and thus the domain of other disciplines... .This is one place where the humanist can help the \neconomist. If narrative economics is going  to help us understand how rivals duke it out, who wins and who \nloses, we are going to need  much more than lessons from epidemiological studies of viruses or intracranial \nstimu li.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 95, "end_char_idx": 3957, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba7a5945-1bbb-430a-a858-ed9c74f184e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba7a5945-1bbb-430a-a858-ed9c74f184e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "e9ce7d72-0cbc-491a-977d-e52fc9a2355b.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a7254106-4ad8-4298-8190-48e3c057dc72", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "e9ce7d72-0cbc-491a-977d-e52fc9a2355b.pdf"}, "hash": "230ce9618238dc5c410ba6f549174f3f6f9ef664f630bd0bb65200d84d4fb418", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Actual CAT 2024 \nSlot - I  \n \n2 \n2.

Based on the \npassage, choose the best answer for each question.  \n \n... [T]he idea of craftsmanship is not simply  nostalgic. .. . Crafts require distinct skills, an all -round approach \nto work that involves the whole product, rather than individual parts, and an  attitude that necessitates devotion \nto the job and a focus on the communal interest. The  concept of craft e mphasises the human touch and \nindividual judgment.  \n \nEssentially, the crafts concept seems to run against the preponderant ethos of management  studies which, as \nthe academics note, have long prioritised efficiency and consistency. . . .  Craft skills were po rtrayed as being \nprimitive and traditionalist.  \n \nThe contrast between artisanship and efficiency first came to the fore in the 19 century  when British \nmanufacturers suddenly faced competition from across the Atlantic as firms  developed the \u201cAmerican system\u201d  \nusing standardised parts. . . . the worldwide success of the  Singer sewing machine showed the potential of a \nmass -produced device. This process  created its own reaction, first in the form of the Arts and Crafts \nmovement of the late 19th century, and then again in the \u201csmall is beautiful\u2019 movement of the 1970s. A third \ncrafts  movement is emerging as people become aware of the environmental impact of conventional  industry.  \n \nThere are two potential markets for those who practise crafts. The first stems from t he existence of consumers \nwho are willing to pay a premium price for goods that are deemed to  be of extra quality... . The second market \nlies in those consumers who wish to use their  purchases to support local workers, or to reduce their \nenvironmental impa ct by taking goods  to craftspeople to be mended, or recycled.  \n \nFor workers, the appeal of craftsmanship is that it allows them the autonomy to make creative  choices, and \nthus makes a job far more satisfying. In that sense, it could offer hope for the  overa ll labour market. Let the \nmachines automate dull and repetitive tasks and let workers  focus purely on their skills, judgment and \nimagination. As a current example, the academics  cite the \u201cagile\u201d manifesto in the software sector, an industry \nat the heart of  technological  change. The pioneers behind the original agile manifesto promised to prioritise \n\u201cindividuals  and interactions over processes and tools\u201d. By bringing together experts from different teams,  \nagile working is designed to improve creativity.  \n \nBut the broader question is whether crafts can create a lot more jobs than they do today.  Demand for crafted \nproducts may rise but will it be easy to retrain workers in sectors that  might get automated (such as truck \ndrivers) to take advantage? In a world whe re products  and services often have to pass through regulatory \nhoops, large companies will usually have  the advantage.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21, "end_char_idx": 4371, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff153ffb-7020-41e6-8a67-02a41ce36989": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff153ffb-7020-41e6-8a67-02a41ce36989", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "e9ce7d72-0cbc-491a-977d-e52fc9a2355b.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cbf950bf-ab3f-4975-b2f6-054f026cfe74", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "e9ce7d72-0cbc-491a-977d-e52fc9a2355b.pdf"}, "hash": "f7e1b92cf3d104f1fd3d91320c157c82c51f37eb4acb63fddb1ff8192c8087d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5 \nActual CAT 2024 \nSlot - I \nDIRECTIONS for questions 12 to 15: The passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the \npassage, choose the  best answer for each question.  \n \nLanding in Australia, the British colonists weren't much impressed with the small -bodied,  slender -snooted \nmarsupials called bandicoots. \u201cTheir muzzle, which is much too long, gives  them an air exceedingly stu pid,\u201d \none naturalist noted in 1805. They nicknamed one type the  \u201czebra rat\u2019 because of its black -striped rump.  \n \nSilly -looking or not, though, the zebra rat \u2014the smallest bandicoot, more commonly known  today as the \nwestern barred bandicoot \u2014exhibited a genius  for survival in the harsh outback,  where its ancestors had \npersisted for some 26 million years. Its births were triggered by  rainfall in the bone -dry desert. It carried its \nbreath -mint-size babies in a backward -facing  pouch so mothers could forage for foo d and dig shallow, \ncamouflaged shelters.  \n \nStill, these adaptations did not prepare the western barred bandicoot for the colonial -era transformation of its \necosystem, particularly the onslaught of imported British animals, from  cattle and rabbits that damag ed \ndelicate desert vegetation to ravenous house cats that soon  developed a taste for bandicoots. Several of the \ndozen -odd bandicoot species went extinct,  and by the 1940s the western barred bandicoot, whose original \nrange stretched across much  of the conti nent, persisted only on two predator -free islands in Shark Bay, off \nAustralia\u2019s  western coast.  \n \n\u201cOur isolated fauna had simply not been exposed to these predators,\u201d says Reece Pedler, an  ecologist with the \nWild Deserts conservation program.  \n \nNow Wild Deser ts is using descendants of those few thousand island survivors, called Shark  Bay bandicoots, \nin a new effort to seed a mainland bandicoot revival. They've imported 20  bandicoots to a preserve on the \nedge of the Strzelecki Desert, in the remote interior of New  South Wales. This sanctuary is a challenging \nplace, desolate much of the year, with one of  the world\u2019s most mercurial rainfall patterns \u2014relentless droughts \nfollowed by sudden  drenching floods.  \n \nThe imported bandicoots occupy two fenced \u201cexclosures,\u201d cl eared of invasive rabbits  (courtesy of Pedler\u2019s \nsheepdog) and of feral cats (which slunk off once the rabbits  disappeared). A third fenced area contains the \nprogram\u2019s Wild Training Zone, where two other  rare marsupials (bilbies, a larger type of bandicoot,  and \nmulgaras, a somewhat fearsome  fuzzball known for sucking the brains out of prey) currently share terrain with \ncontrolled  numbers of cats, learning to evade them. It's unclear whether the Shark Bay bandicoots,  which are \nperhaps even more predator -naive  than their now -extinct mainland bandicoot kin,  will be able to make that \nkind of breakthrough.  \n \nFor now, though, a recent surge of rainfall has led to a bandicoot joey boom, raising the Wild  Deserts \npopulation to about 100, with other sanctuaries adding t o that number. There are also  signs of rebirth in the \nlandscape itself. With their constant digging, the bandicoots trap  moisture and allow for seed germination so \nthe cattle -damaged desert can restore itself.  \nThey have a new nickname \u2014a flattering one, thi s time. \u201cWe call them ecosystem engineers,\u201d  Pedler says.  \n \n12.

All codes, linguistic and visual, have a natural origin but some are  so widespread that  they \nbecome universal. This is what hides the mechanism of coding behind signs.  \n B.  Learning linguistic and visual signs at an early age makes all such codes appear  natural. This \nnaturalization of codes is the effect of ideology.  \n C.  Not all codes are natural but certain codes are naturalized and made to appear  universal. Ideology \naims to hide the mechanism of coding behind signs.  \n D.  Language and visual signs are codes.

Either way, academic publishing \nwould likely crumble without them.  \n \nIn recent years, some scientists have begun posting their reviews online, mainly to claim  credit for their work. \nSites like Publons allow researchers to either sh are entire referee reports  or simply list the journals for whom \nthey've carried out a review....  \n \nThe rise of Publons suggests that academics are increasingly placing value on the work of  peer review and \nasking others, such as grant funders, to do the same . While that\u2019s vital in the  publish -or-perish culture of \nacademia, there\u2019s also immense value in the data underlying peer  review. Sharing peer review data could help \njournals stamp out fraud, inefficiency, and  systemic bias in academic publishing.....  \n \nPeer review data could also help root out bias. Last year, a study based on peer review data  for nearly 24,000 \nsubmissions to the biomedical journal eLife found that women and non -Westerners were vastly \nunderrepresented among peer reviewers. Only around one i n every  five reviewers was female, and less than \ntwo percent of reviewers were based in developing  countries. ... Openly publishing peer review data could \nperhaps also help journals address  another problem in academic publishing: fraudulent peer reviews. F or \ninstance, a minority of  authors have been known to use phony email addresses to pose as an outside expert \nand review their own manuscripts....  \n \nOpponents of open peer review commonly argue that confidentiality is vital to the integrity of  the review \nprocess; referees may be less critical of manuscripts if their reports are published,  especially if they are \nrevealing their identities by sig ning them. Some also hold concern s that  open reviewing may deter referees \nfrom agreeing to judge manuscripts in the f irst place, or  that they'll take longer to do so out of fear of \nscrutiny...  \n \nEven when the content of reviews and the identity of reviewers can\u2019t be shared publicly,  perhaps journ als \ncould share the data with outside researchers for study. Or they could  release other figures that wouldn\u2019t \ncompromise the anonymity of reviews but that might  answer important questions about how long the \nreviewing process takes, how many  researchers editors have to reach out to on average to find one who will \ncarry out the work , and the geographic distribution of peer reviewers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 97, "end_char_idx": 4194, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27e73494-85d2-476a-a081-adec7ad06065": {"__data__": {"id_": "27e73494-85d2-476a-a081-adec7ad06065", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "e9ce7d72-0cbc-491a-977d-e52fc9a2355b.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4496240e-5586-4db0-8b64-469375ce81dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "e9ce7d72-0cbc-491a-977d-e52fc9a2355b.pdf"}, "hash": "0dba8fdfba2fa77cdeff089c9fda63a5f04aca822056e8b58503e18b9882f51e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5 \nActual CAT 2024 \nSlot - II \nOf course, opening up data underlying the reviewing process will not fix peer review entirely,  and there may \nbe instances in which there are valid reasons to keep the content of peer  reviews hidden and t he identity of the \nreferees confidential.

Based on the \npassage, choose the best  answer for each question.  \n \n[S]pices were a global commodity centuries before European voyages. There was a complex chain of \nrelations, yet consumers had little knowledge of producers and vice versa. Desire for  spices helped fuel \nEuropean colonial empires to create political, military and commercial  networks under a single power.  \n \nHistorians know a fair amount about the supply of spices in Europe during the medieval  period \u2013 the origins, \nmethods of transportation, the prices \u2013 but less about demand. Why go  to such extraordinary efforts to procure \nexpensive products from exotic lands? Still, demand  was great enough to inspire the voyages of Christopher \nColumbus and Vasco Da Gama,  launching the first fateful wave of European colonialism. . . .  \n \nSo, why were sp ices so highly prized in Europe in the centuries from about 1000 to 1500?  One widely \ndisseminated explanation for medieval demand for spices was that they covered  the taste of spoiled meat. . . .  \n \nMedieval purchasers consumed meat much fresher than what  the average city -dweller in the developed world \nof today has at hand. However, refrigeration  was not available, and some hot spices have been shown to serve \nas an anti -bacterial agent.  Salting, smoking or drying meat were other means of preservation. Most s pices used \nin cooking began as medical ingredients, and throughout the Middle Ages spices were used as  both medicines \nand condiments. Above all, medieval recipes involve the combination of  medical and culinary lore in order to \nbalance food's humeral proper ties and prevent disease.  Most spices were hot and dry and so appropriate in \nsauces to counteract the moist and wet  properties supposedly possessed by most meat and fish. . . .  \n \nWhere spices came from was known in a vague sense centuries before the voyages  of Columbus. Just how \nvague may be judged by looking at medieval world maps . . . To the  medieval European imagination, the East \nwas exotic and alluring. Medieval maps often  placed India close to the so -called Earthly Paradise, the Garden \nof Eden describe d in the  Bible.  \n \nGeographical knowledge has a lot to do with the perceptions of spices' relative scarcity and  the reasons for \ntheir high prices. An example of the varying notions of scarcity is the  conflicting information about how \npepper is harvested. As far back as the 7th century  Europeans thought that pepper in India grew on trees \n\"guarded\" by serpents that would bite  and poison anyone who attempted to gather the fruit. The only way to \nharvest pepper was to  burn the trees, which would drive the snakes u nderground.

Based on the \npassage, choose the  best answer for each question.  \n \n(...) There are three other common drivers for ca rnivore \u2013human attacks, some of which are  more preventable \nthan others. Natural aggression -based conflicts \u2013 such a s those involving  females protecting their young or \nanimals protecting a food source \u2013 can often be avoided as  long as people stay away from those animals and \ntheir food.  \n \nCarnivores that recognise humans as a means to get food, are a different story. As t hey become more reliant \non human food they might find at campsites or in rubbish bins, they  become less avoidant of humans. Losing \nthat instinctive fear response puts them into more  situations where they could get into an altercation with a \nhuman, which of ten results in that  bear being put down by humans. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear,\u201d says \nServheen, referring to a  common saying among biologists and conservationists.  \n \nPredatory or predation -related attacks are quite rare, only accounting for 17% of attacks in  North America \nsince 1955. They occur when a carnivore views a human as prey and hunts it  like it would any other animal it \nuses for food. ( \u2026) \n \nThen there are animal attacks provoked by people taking pictures with them or feeding them  in natural \nsettings s uch as national parks which often end with animals being euthanised out  of precaution. \u201cEventually, \nthat animal becomes habituated to people, and [then] bad things  happen to the animal. And the folks who \ninitially wanted to make that connection don\u2019t  neces sarily realise that,\u201d says Christine Wilkinson, a \npostdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley,  California, who\u2019s been studying coyote -human conflicts.  \n \nAfter conducting countless postmortems on all types of carnivore -human attacks spanning 75  years, \nPenteriani\u2019 s team believes 50% could have been avoided if humans reacted differently.  A 2017 study co -\nauthored by Penteriani found that engaging in risky behaviour around large  carnivores increases the likelihood \nof an attack.  \n \nTwo of the most common risky behaviours  are parents leaving their children to play outside  unattended and \nwalking an unleashed dog, according to the study. Wilkinson says 66% of  coyote attacks involve a dog. \n\u201c[People] end up in a situation where their dog is being chased,  or their dog chases a coyote, or maybe they\u2019re \nwalking their dog near a den that's marked,  and the coyote wants to escort them away,\u201d says Wilkinson.  \n \nExperts believe climate change also plays a part in the escalation of human -carnivore  conflicts, but the \ncorrelation still need s to be ironed out. \u201cAs finite resources become scarcer,  carnivores and people are coming \ninto more frequent contact, which means that more conflict  could occur,\u201d says Jen Miller, international \nprogramme specialist for the US Fish & Wildlife  Service.

The likelihood of human -carnivore conflicts appears to be higher in areas of low -income  countries \ndominated by vast rural landscapes and farmland, according to Penteriani\u2019s  research. \u201cThere are a lot of \nworking landscapes in the Global South that are really  heterogeneous, that are interspersed with carnivore \nhabitats, forests and savannahs, which  creates  a lot more opportunity for these encounters, just statistically,\u201d \nsays Wilkinson.  \n \n18.

Given the  insights provided by Penteriani\u2019s research and Wilkinson's statement, which  of the \nfollowing conclusions can be drawn about the relationship between landscape  heterogeneity and \nhuman -carnivore conflicts?  \n \n A.  Low-income countries with vast, contiguous wi lderness areas are less prone to  human -carnivore \nconflicts because these areas lack the human presence necessary for such  encounters.  \n B.  Homogeneous landscapes with uniform agricultural practices are more likely to  experience high \nrates of human -carnivor e conflicts due to the predictability of resources.  \n C.  The diversity and interspersion of working landscapes with carnivore habitats in rural  areas \nincrease the statistical probability of encounters between humans and carnivores.  \n D.  Landscape heterogen eity, characterized by a mix of farmland and natural habitats,  inherently \nreduces the chances of human -carnivore conflicts by providing more refuge for  wildlife away \nfrom human activity.  \n \n21.

Based on the \npassage, choose the best answer for each question.  \n \nFears of artificial intelli gence (AI) have haunted humanity since the very beginning of the  computer age. \nHitherto these fears focused on machines using physical means to kill,  enslave or replace people. But over the \npast couple of years new AI tools have emerged that threaten  the s urvival of human civilisation from an \nunexpected direction. AI has gained some  remarkable abilities to manipulate and generate language, whether \nwith words, sounds or  images. AI has thereby hacked the operating system of our civilisation.   \n \nLanguage is the  stuff almost all human culture is made of. Human rights, for example, aren\u2019t  inscribed in our \nDNA. Rather, they are cultural artefacts we created by telling stories and  writing laws. Gods aren\u2019t physical \nrealities. Rather, they are cultural artefacts we c reated by  inventing myths and writing scriptures\u2026.What \nwould happen once a non -human intelligence becomes  better than the average human at telling stories, \ncomposing melodies, drawing images , and writing laws and scriptures? When people think about Chatgpt  and \nother new AI  tools, they are often drawn to examples like school children using AI to write their essays.  What \nwill happen to the school system when kids do that? But this kind of question misses  the big picture. Forget \nabout school essays. Think of t he next American presidential race in2024, and try to imagine the impact of AI \ntools that can be made to mass -produce political  content, fake -news stories and scriptures for new cults\u2026  \n \nThrough its mastery of language, AI could even form intimate relations hips with people, and  use the power of \nintimacy to change our opinions and worldviews. Although there is no  indication that AI has any \nconsciousness or feelings of its own, to foster fake intimacy with  humans it is enough if the AI can make them \nfeel emoti onally attached to it\u2026.  \n \nWhat will happen to the course of history when AI takes over culture, and begins producing  stories, melodies, \nlaws and religions? Previous tools like the printing press and radio helped  spread the cultural ideas of humans, \nbut they  never created new cultural ideas of their own.AI is fundamentally different. AI can create completely \nnew ideas, completely new culture\u2026.Of course, the new power of AI could be used for good purposes as \nwell. I won\u2019t dwell on this,  because the people who develop AI talk about it enough\u2026.  \n \nWe can still regulate the new AI tools, but we must act quickly. Whereas nukes cannot invent  more powerful \nnukes, AI can make exponentially more powerful AI.\u2026 Unregulated AI  deployments would create social \nchaos, which wo uld benefit autocrats and ruin democracies.  Democracy is a conversation, and conversations \nrely on language. When AI hacks language,  it could destroy our ability to have meaningful conversations, \nthereby destroying  democracy\u2026.And the first regulation I wou ld suggest is to make it mandatory for AI to  \ndisclose that it is an AI. If I am having a conversation with someone, and I cannot tell whether  it is a human or \nan AI \u2014that\u2019s the end of democracy. This text has been generated by a  human. Or has it?  \n \n1.

Sadly, the physical  annihilation of communities \nof native speakers of a language is all too often the cause of  language extinction. In North America, Europ ean \ncolonists brought death and destruction to  many Native American communities. This was followed by US \nfederal policies restricting the  use of indigenous languages, including the removal of native children from \ntheir communities  to federal boarding schoo ls where native languages and cultural practices were prohibited. \nAs many as 75 percent of the languages spoken in the territories that became the United States  have gone \nextinct, with slightly better language survival rates in Central and South America . .. \n \nEven without physical annihilation and prohibitions against language use, the language of the  \"dominant\" \ncultures may drive other languages into extinction; young people see education,  jobs, culture and technology \nassociated with the dominant language and focus their attention  on that language.

Based on the \npassage, choose the  best answer for each question.  \n \nThere is a group in the space community who view the  solar system not as an opportunity to  expand human \npotential but as a nature preserve, forever the provenance of an elite group of  scientists and their sanitary \nrobotic probes. These planetary protection advocates [call] for  avoiding \u201charmful contaminatio n\u201d of celestial \nbodies. Under this regime, NASA incurs great  expense sterilizing robotic probes in order to prevent the \ncontamination of entirely theoretical  biospheres. . . .  \n \nTransporting bacteria would matter if Mars were the vital world once imagined b y astronomers  who mistook \noptical illusions for canals. Nobody wants to expose Martians to measles, but  sadly, robotic exploration \nreveals a bleak, rusted landscape, lacking oxygen and flooded with  radiation ready to sterilize any Earthly \nmicrobes. Simple life might exist underground, or down  at the bottom of a deep canyon, but it has been very \nhard to find with robots. . . . The upsides  from human exploration and development of Mars clearly outweigh \nthe welfare of purely  speculative Martian fungi. . . .  \n \nThe other likely targets of human exploration, development, and settlement, our moon and  the asteroids, exist \nin a desiccated, radiation -soaked realm of hard vacuum and extreme  temperature variations that would kill \nnearly anything. It\u2019s also important to n ote that many  international competitors will ignore the demands of \nthese protection extremists in any case.  For example, China recently sent a terrarium to the moon and \ngerminated a plant seed \u2014with,  unsurprisingly, no protest from its own scientific commun ity. In contrast, \nwhen it was recently  revealed that a researcher had surreptitiously smuggled super -resilient microscopic  \ntardigrades aboard the ill -fated Israeli Beresheet lunar probe, a firestorm was unleashed  within the space \ncommunity. . . .  \n \nNASA\u2019s p revious human exploration efforts made no serious attempt at sterility, with little  notice. As the \nMars expert Robert Zubrin noted in the National Review, U.S. lunar landings  did not leave the campsites \ncleaner than they found it. Apollo\u2019s bacteria -infeste d litter included  bags of feces. Forcing NASA\u2019s proposed \nMars exploration to do better, scrubbing everything  and hauling out all the trash, would destroy NASA\u2019s \nhuman exploration budget and encroach  on the agency\u2019s other directorates, too. Getting future a stronauts off \nMars is enough of a  challenge, without trying to tote weeks of waste along as well.  \n \nA reasonable compromise is to continue on the course laid out by the U.S. government and  the National \nResearch Council, which proposed a system of zones on M ars, some for science  only, some for habitation, and \nsome for resource exploitation. This approach minimizes  contamination, maximizes scientific exploration . . . \nMars presents a stark choice of diverging  human futures. We can turn inward, pursuing ever mo re limited \nfutures while we await  whichever natural or manmade disaster will eradicate our species and life on Earth.  \nAlternatively, we can choose to propel our biosphere further into the solar system,  simultaneously protecting \nour home planet and providin g a backup plan for the only life we  know exists in the universe.
